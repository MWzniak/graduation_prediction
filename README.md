# graduation_ptrediction
In this notebook i take up the challenge of predictiong whether  a student is going to graduate college.

What can be found inside:
- exploratory data analysis and some data wrangling
- feature selection with statistical testing
- hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation of 3 differnet models (KNN, RF, Linear SVM)
- comparision of scores between regular and tuned models
- forecast of how many currently enrolled students will graduate

Data used in this study is publicaly availible at:

It was previously used in a paper:
